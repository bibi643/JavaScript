Javascript Tutorial.


# Overview

After doing the Golang tuto, I decided to do the Javascript tuto. 
The language is easy to pick as when I studied Beautiful soup or Latex, I was touching the concept of **tags**.

JavaScript is supposed to be complemetary to Python and focused on the frontend part, which seems to fit me more to understand the ideas and visualise it in my day to day work.
